    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Resources must have all required labels with values matching specified patterns.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: allowed-namespace
      labels:
        owner: user.agilebank.demo
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
