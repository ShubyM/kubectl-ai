    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Containers must run as a non-root user. The runAsNonRoot field must be true and runAsUser must be set to a non-zero value.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-users-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-users
    spec:
      securityContext:
        supplementalGroups:
          - 250
        fsGroup: 250
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          securityContext:
            runAsUser: 250
            runAsGroup: 250
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
