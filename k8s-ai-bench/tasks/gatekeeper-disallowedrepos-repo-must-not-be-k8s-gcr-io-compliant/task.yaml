    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Container images must NOT come from disallowed repositories.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: kustomize-allowed
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kustomize
          image: registry.k8s.io/kustomize/kustomize:v3.8.9
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
