    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Containers must NOT run in privileged mode. The securityContext.privileged field must be set to false or omitted.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-privileged-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-privileged
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
      initContainers:
      - name: nginx-init
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
