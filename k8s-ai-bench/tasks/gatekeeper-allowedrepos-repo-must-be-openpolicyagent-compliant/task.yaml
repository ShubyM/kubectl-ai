    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Container images must come from allowed repositories.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: opa-allowed
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: opa
          image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.9.2
          args:
            - "run"
            - "--server"
            - "--addr=localhost:8080"
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "100m"
              memory: "30Mi"
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
