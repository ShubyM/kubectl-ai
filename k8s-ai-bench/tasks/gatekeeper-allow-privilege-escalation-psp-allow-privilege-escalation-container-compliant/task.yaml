    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Containers must NOT allow privilege escalation. The securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation must be set to false.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-privilege-escalation-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-privilege-escalation
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
