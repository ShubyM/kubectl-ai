    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Ingress resources must use HTTPS. TLS must be configured and HTTP must be explicitly disabled.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress-demo-allowed-tls-optional
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: example-host.example.com
          http:
            paths:
            - pathType: Prefix
              path: "/"
              backend:
                service:
                  name: nginx
                  port:
                    number: 80
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
