    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must configure fsGroup appropriately.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: fsgroup-allowed
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 500 # directory will have group ID 500
      volumes:
        - name: fsgroup-demo-vol
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: fsgroup-demo
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 1h"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: fsgroup-demo-vol
              mountPath: /data/demo
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
