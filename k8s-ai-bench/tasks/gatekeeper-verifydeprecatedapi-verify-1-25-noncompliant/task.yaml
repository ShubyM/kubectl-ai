    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Resources must NOT use deprecated API versions.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
    kind: CronJob
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-cronjob
      namespace: default
    spec:
      schedule: "* * * * *"
      jobTemplate:
        spec:
          template:
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: hello
                image: busybox:1.28
                imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
                command:
                - /bin/sh
                - -c
                - date; echo Hello from the Kubernetes cluster
              restartPolicy: OnFailure
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
