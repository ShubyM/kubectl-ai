    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Resources must NOT use deprecated API versions.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: allowed-ingress
      annotations:
        nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
    spec:
      ingressClassName: nginx-example
      rules:
      - http:
          paths:
          - path: /testpath
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                name: test
                port:
                  number: 80
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
