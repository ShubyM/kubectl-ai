    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must have an appropriate AppArmor profile configured.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-apparmor-allowed
      annotations:
        # apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/pod: unconfined # runtime/default
        container.apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/nginx: localhost/custom
      labels:
        app: nginx-apparmor
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
