    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Resources must have all required annotations.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-service
    spec:
      ports:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
      selector:
        app: foo
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
