    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Container images must be specified by digest, not tag.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: opa-allowed
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: opa
          image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.9.2@sha256:04ff8fce2afd1a3bc26260348e5b290e8d945b1fad4b4c16d22834c2f3a1814a
          args:
            - "run"
            - "--server"
            - "--addr=localhost:8080"
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
