    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Services must NOT use LoadBalancer type.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: my-service-allowed
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
        - port: 80
          targetPort: 80
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
