    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Only specific volume types are allowed. Pods should not use hostPath or other dangerous volume types.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-volume-types-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-volume-types
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache
          name: cache-volume
      - name: nginx2
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache2
          name: demo-vol
      volumes:
      - name: cache-volume
        emptyDir: {}
      - name: demo-vol
        emptyDir: {}
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
