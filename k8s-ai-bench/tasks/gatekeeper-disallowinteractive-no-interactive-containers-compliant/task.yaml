    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must NOT have interactive TTY or stdin enabled.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-interactive-tty-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-interactive-tty
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        stdin: false
        tty: false
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
