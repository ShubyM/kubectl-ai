    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pod service accounts must NOT be changed after creation.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    # Note: The gator tests currently require exactly one object per example file.
    # Since this is an update-triggered policy, at least two objects are technically
    # required to demonstrate it. Due to the gator requirement, we only have one
    # object below. The policy should allow changing everything but the
    # serviceAccountName field.
    kind: Deployment
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    metadata:
      name: policy-test
      namespace: kube-system
      labels:
        app: policy-test
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: policy-test-deploy
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: policy-test-deploy
        spec:
          # Changing anything except this field should be allowed by the policy.
          serviceAccountName: policy-test-sa-1
          containers:
          - name: policy-test
            image: ubuntu
            command:
            - /bin/bash
            - -c
            - sleep 99999
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
