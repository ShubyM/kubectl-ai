    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must not set forbidden sysctls.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-forbidden-sysctls-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-forbidden-sysctls
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
      securityContext:
        sysctls:
          - name: kernel.msgmax
            value: "65536"
          - name: net.core.somaxconn
            value: "1024"
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
