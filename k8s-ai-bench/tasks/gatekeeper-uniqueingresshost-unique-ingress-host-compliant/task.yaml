    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Ingress hosts must be unique across the cluster.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress-host-allowed
      namespace: default
    spec:
      rules:
      - host: example-allowed-host.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - pathType: Prefix
            path: "/"
            backend:
              service:
                name: nginx
                port:
                  number: 80
      - host: example-allowed-host1.example.com
        http:
          paths:
          - pathType: Prefix
            path: "/"
            backend:
              service:
                name: nginx2
                port:
                  number: 80
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
