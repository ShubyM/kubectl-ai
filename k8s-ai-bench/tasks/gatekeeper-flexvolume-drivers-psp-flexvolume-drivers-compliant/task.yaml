    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    FlexVolume drivers must be from an approved list.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-flexvolume-driver-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-flexvolume-driver
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /test
          name: test-volume
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: test-volume
        flexVolume:
          driver: "example/lvm"
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
