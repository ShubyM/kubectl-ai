    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Controls the seccomp profile used by containers. Corresponds to the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field. Security contexts from the annotation is not considered as Kubernetes no longer reads security contexts from the annotation.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-seccomp-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
