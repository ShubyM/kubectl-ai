    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Deployments/ReplicaSets must have replica counts within allowed ranges.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: allowed-deployment
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
