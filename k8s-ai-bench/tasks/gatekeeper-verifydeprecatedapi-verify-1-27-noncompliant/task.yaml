    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Resources must NOT use deprecated API versions.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1
    kind: CSIStorageCapacity
    metadata:
      name: allowed-csistoragecapacity
      namespace: default
    storageClassName: standard
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
