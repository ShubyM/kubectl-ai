    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must NOT share the host's PID, IPC, or network namespaces. hostPID, hostIPC, and hostNetwork must all be false.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-namespace-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-host-namespace
    spec:
      hostPID: false
      hostIPC: false
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
