    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must NOT mount sensitive host filesystem paths. hostPath volumes should be restricted or disallowed.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-filesystem
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache
          name: cache-volume
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: cache-volume
        hostPath:
          path: /tmp # directory location on host
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
