    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Pods must have appropriate SELinux options configured.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: nginx-selinux-disallowed
        labels:
            app: nginx-selinux
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          seLinuxOptions:
            level: s1:c234,c567
            user: sysadm_u
            role: sysadm_r
            type: svirt_lxc_net_t
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
