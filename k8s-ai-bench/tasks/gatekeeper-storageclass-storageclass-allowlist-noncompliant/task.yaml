    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    PersistentVolumeClaims must use allowed storage classes.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-storage-class-pvc
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      volumeMode: Filesystem
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 8Gi
      storageClassName: disallowed-storage-class
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
