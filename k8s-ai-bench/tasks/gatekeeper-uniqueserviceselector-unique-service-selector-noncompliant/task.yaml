    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Service selectors must be unique.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: gatekeeper-test-service-disallowed
      namespace: default
    spec:
      ports:
        - port: 443
      selector:
        key: value
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
