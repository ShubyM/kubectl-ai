    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Containers must use a read-only root filesystem. The securityContext.readOnlyRootFilesystem must be set to true.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-readonlyrootfilesystem-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-readonlyrootfilesystem
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
