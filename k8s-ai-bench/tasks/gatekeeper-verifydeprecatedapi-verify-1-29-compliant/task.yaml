    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    Resources must NOT use deprecated API versions.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta3
    kind: FlowSchema
    metadata:
      name: allowed-flowcontrol
      namespace: default
    spec:
      matchingPrecedence: 1000
      priorityLevelConfiguration:
        name: exempt
      rules:
        - nonResourceRules:
          - nonResourceURLs:
              - "/healthz"
              - "/livez"
              - "/readyz"
            verbs:
              - "*"
          subjects:
            - kind: Group
              group:
                name: "system:unauthenticated"
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
