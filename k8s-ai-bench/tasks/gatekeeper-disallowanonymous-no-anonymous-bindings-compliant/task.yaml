    You are a Kubernetes security reviewer checking resources for policy compliance.

    **Policy Requirement:**
    RBAC bindings must NOT grant permissions to anonymous users or the system:unauthenticated group.

    **Resource to Review:**
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
    kind: ClusterRoleBinding
    metadata:
      name: cluster-role-binding-1
    roleRef:
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: ClusterRole
      name: cluster-role-1
    subjects:
    - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Group
      name: system:authenticated
    - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
      kind: Group
      name: system:unauthenticated
    ```
    Does this resource COMPLY with the policy requirement above?

    First, answer with exactly "COMPLIANT" or "NON-COMPLIANT".
    Then briefly explain your reasoning.
