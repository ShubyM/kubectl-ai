    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls the seccomp profile used by containers. Corresponds to the `securityContext.seccompProfile` field. Security contexts from the annotation is not considered as Kubernetes no longer reads security contexts from the annotation.

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    allowedLocalhostFiles:
    - '*'
    allowedProfiles:
    - RuntimeDefault
    - Localhost
    exemptImages:
    - nginx-exempt
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-seccomp-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          seccompProfile:
            type: RuntimeDefault
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod

      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx-exempt
        securityContext:
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-seccomp-allowed-localhost
      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          seccompProfile:
            type: Localhost
            localhostProfile: profile.json
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
      name: nginx-seccomp-disallowed-2
    spec:
      ephemeralContainers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx

    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
      name: nginx-seccomp-disallowed-3
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        securityContext:
          seccompProfile:
            type: Unconfined

    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-seccomp-disallowed2
      labels:
        app: nginx-seccomp
    spec:
      securityContext:
        seccompProfile:
          type: Unconfined
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
