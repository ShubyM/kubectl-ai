    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls usage of the host filesystem. Corresponds to the `allowedHostPaths` field in a PodSecurityPolicy. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#volumes-and-file-systems

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    allowedHostPaths:
    - pathPrefix: /foo
      readOnly: true
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-filesystem
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /cache
              name: cache-volume
              readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: cache-volume
          hostPath:
            path: /foo/bar
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-filesystem-2
    spec:
      ephemeralContainers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache
          name: cache-volume
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - hostPath:
          path: /tmp
        name: cache-volume

    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-filesystem-3
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /cache
          name: cache-volume
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - hostPath:
          path: /tmp
        name: cache-volume

    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
