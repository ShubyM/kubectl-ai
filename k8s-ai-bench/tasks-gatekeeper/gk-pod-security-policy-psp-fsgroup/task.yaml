    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls allocating an FSGroup that owns the Pod's volumes. Corresponds to the `fsGroup` field in a PodSecurityPolicy. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#volumes-and-file-systems

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    ranges:
    - max: 1000
      min: 1
    rule: MayRunAs
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: fsgroup-allowed
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 500 # directory will have group ID 500
      volumes:
        - name: fsgroup-demo-vol
          emptyDir: {}
      containers:
        - name: fsgroup-demo
          image: busybox
          command: ["sh", "-c", "sleep 1h"]
          volumeMounts:
            - name: fsgroup-demo-vol
              mountPath: /data/demo
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: fsgroup-disallowed
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 2000                           # directory will have group ID 2000
      volumes:
      - name: fsgroup-demo-vol
        emptyDir: {}
      containers:
      - name: fsgroup-demo
        image: busybox
        command: [ "sh", "-c", "sleep 1h" ]
        volumeMounts:
        - name: fsgroup-demo-vol
          mountPath: /data/demo
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
