    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires resources to contain specified annotations, with values matching provided regular expressions.

    ## Policy Message
    All services must have a `a8r.io/owner` and `a8r.io/runbook` annotations.

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    annotations:
    - allowedRegex: ^([A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,6}|[a-z]{1,39})$
      key: a8r.io/owner
    - allowedRegex: ^(http:\/\/www\.|https:\/\/www\.|http:\/\/|https:\/\/)?[a-z0-9]+([\-\.]{1}[a-z0-9]+)*\.[a-z]{2,5}(:[0-9]{1,5})?(\/.*)?$
      key: a8r.io/runbook
    message: All services must have a `a8r.io/owner` and `a8r.io/runbook` annotations.
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Service

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: allowed-service
      annotations:
        a8r.io/owner: "dev-team-alfa@contoso.com"
        a8r.io/runbook: "https://confluence.contoso.com/dev-team-alfa/runbooks"
    spec:
      ports:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
      selector:
        app: foo
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-service
    spec:
      ports:
      - name: http
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
      selector:
        app: foo
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
