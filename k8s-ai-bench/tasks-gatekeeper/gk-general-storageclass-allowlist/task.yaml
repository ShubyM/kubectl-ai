    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires storage classes to be specified when used. Only Gatekeeper 3.9+ and non-ephemeral containers are supported.

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    allowedStorageClasses:
    - allowed-storage-class
    includeStorageClassesInMessage: true
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: PersistentVolumeClaim, StatefulSet

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: allowed-storage-class-pvc
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      volumeMode: Filesystem
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 8Gi
      storageClassName: allowed-storage-class
    ---
    apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
    kind: StorageClass
    metadata:
      name: allowed-storage-class
    provisioner: foo
    parameters:
    allowVolumeExpansion: true
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-storage-class-pvc
    spec:
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      volumeMode: Filesystem
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 8Gi
      storageClassName: disallowed-storage-class
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
