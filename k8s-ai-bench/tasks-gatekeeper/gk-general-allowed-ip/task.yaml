    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Restricts Service externalIPs to an allowed list of IP addresses.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#external-ips

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    allowedIPs:
    - 203.0.113.0
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Service

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: allowed-external-ip
    spec:
      selector:
        app: MyApp
      ports:
        - name: http
          protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 8080
      externalIPs:
        - 203.0.113.0
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-external-ip
    spec:
      selector:
        app: MyApp
      ports:
      - name: http
        protocol: TCP
        port: 80
        targetPort: 8080
      externalIPs:
        - 1.1.1.1
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
