    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls the ability of any container to enable privileged mode. Corresponds to the `privileged` field in a PodSecurityPolicy. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#privileged

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    exemptImages:
    - safeimages.com/*
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-privileged-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-privileged
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          privileged: false
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-privileged-allowed-exempt
      labels:
        app: nginx-privileged
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: safeimages.com/nginx
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-privileged-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-privileged
    spec:
      ephemeralContainers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-privileged
      name: nginx-privileged-disallowed-2
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        securityContext:
          privileged: true
      initContainers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx-init
        securityContext:
          privileged: true

    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
