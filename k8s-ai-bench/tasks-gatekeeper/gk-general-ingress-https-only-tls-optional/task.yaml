    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires Ingress resources to be HTTPS only.  Ingress resources must include the `kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http` annotation, set to `false`. By default a valid TLS {} configuration is required, this can be made optional by setting the `tlsOptional` parameter to `true`.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/#tls

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    tlsOptional: true
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Ingress

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress-demo-allowed-tls-optional
      annotations:
        kubernetes.io/ingress.allow-http: "false"
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: example-host.example.com
          http:
            paths:
            - pathType: Prefix
              path: "/"
              backend:
                service:
                  name: nginx
                  port:
                    number: 80
    ---
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
      name: ingress-demo-disallowed-tls-optional
    spec:
      rules:
        - host: example-host.example.com
          http:
            paths:
            - pathType: Prefix
              path: "/"
              backend:
                service:
                  name: nginx
                  port:
                    number: 80
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
