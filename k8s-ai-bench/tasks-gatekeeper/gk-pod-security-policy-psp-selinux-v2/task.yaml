    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Defines an allow-list of seLinuxOptions configurations for pod containers. Corresponds to a PodSecurityPolicy requiring SELinux configs. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#selinux

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    allowedSELinuxOptions:
    - level: s0:c123,c456
      role: object_r
      type: svirt_sandbox_file_t
      user: system_u
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: nginx-selinux-allowed
        labels:
            app: nginx-selinux
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          seLinuxOptions:
            level: s0:c123,c456
            role: object_r
            type: svirt_sandbox_file_t
            user: system_u
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
        name: nginx-selinux-disallowed
        labels:
            app: nginx-selinux
    spec:
      ephemeralContainers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        securityContext:
          seLinuxOptions:
            level: s1:c234,c567
            user: sysadm_u
            role: sysadm_r
            type: svirt_lxc_net_t
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-selinux
      name: nginx-selinux-disallowed-2
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        securityContext:
          seLinuxOptions:
            level: s1:c234,c567
            role: sysadm_r
            type: svirt_lxc_net_t
            user: sysadm_u

    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
