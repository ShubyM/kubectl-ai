    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires resources to contain specified labels, with values matching provided regular expressions.

    ## Policy Message
    All pods must have label of key `pizza` regardless of the label's value

    ## Policy Parameters

    labels:
    - key: pizza
    message: All pods must have label of key `pizza` regardless of the label's value
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: has-pizza
      labels:
        pizza: is-great
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: does-not-have-pizza
      labels:
        taco: is-great
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
