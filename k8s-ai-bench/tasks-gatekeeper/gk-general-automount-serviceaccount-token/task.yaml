    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls the ability of any Pod to enable automountServiceAccountToken.

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-automountserviceaccounttoken-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-not-automountserviceaccounttoken
    spec:
      automountServiceAccountToken: false
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-automountserviceaccounttoken-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-automountserviceaccounttoken
    spec:
      automountServiceAccountToken: true
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
