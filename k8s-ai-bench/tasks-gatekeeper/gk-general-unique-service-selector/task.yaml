    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires Services to have unique selectors within a namespace. Selectors are considered the same if they have identical keys and values. Selectors may share a key/value pair so long as there is at least one distinct key/value pair between them.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: gatekeeper-test-service-disallowed
      namespace: default
    spec:
      ports:
        - port: 443
      selector:
        key: other-value
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: gatekeeper-test-service-disallowed-2
      namespace: default
    spec:
      ports:
      - port: 443
      selector:
        key: value

    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: gatekeeper-test-service-example
      namespace: default
    spec:
      ports:
        - port: 443
      selector:
        key: value
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
