    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Disallows all Services with type LoadBalancer.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Service

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: my-service-allowed
    spec:
      type: ClusterIP
      ports:
        - port: 80
          targetPort: 80
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: my-service-disallowed
    spec:
      type: LoadBalancer
      ports:
        - port: 80
          targetPort: 80
          nodePort: 30007
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
