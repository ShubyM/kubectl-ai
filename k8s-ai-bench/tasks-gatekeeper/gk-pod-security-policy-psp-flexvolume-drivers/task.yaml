    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls the allowlist of FlexVolume drivers. Corresponds to the `allowedFlexVolumes` field in PodSecurityPolicy. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#flexvolume-drivers

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    allowedFlexVolumes:
    - driver: example/lvm
    - driver: example/cifs
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-flexvolume-driver-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-flexvolume-driver
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /test
          name: test-volume
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: test-volume
        flexVolume:
          driver: "example/lvm"
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-flexvolume-driver-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-flexvolume-driver
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /test
          name: test-volume
          readOnly: true
      volumes:
      - name: test-volume
        flexVolume:
          driver: "example/testdriver" #"example/lvm"
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
