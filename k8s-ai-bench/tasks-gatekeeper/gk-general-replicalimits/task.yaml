    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires that objects with the field `spec.replicas` (Deployments, ReplicaSets, etc.) specify a number of replicas within defined ranges.

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    ranges:
    - max_replicas: 50
      min_replicas: 3
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Deployment

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: allowed-deployment
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      replicas: 3
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ---
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-deployment
    spec:
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: nginx
      replicas: 100
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: nginx
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: nginx
            image: nginx:1.14.2
            ports:
            - containerPort: 80
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
