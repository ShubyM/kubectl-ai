    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Controls usage of host network namespace by pod containers. HostNetwork verification happens without exception for exemptImages. Specific ports must be specified. Corresponds to the `hostNetwork` and `hostPorts` fields in a PodSecurityPolicy. For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/#host-namespaces

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    exemptImages:
    - safeimages.com/*
    hostNetwork: true
    max: 9000
    min: 80
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-networking-ports-allowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-host-networking-ports
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9000
          hostPort: 80
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-networking-ports-disallowed
      labels:
        app: nginx-host-networking-ports
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:

    spec:
      hostNetwork: false
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-network-true
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: nginx-host-networking-ports-exempted
      labels:
        app: nginx-host-networking-ports
    spec:
      hostNetwork: true
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: safeimages.com/nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9001
          hostPort: 9001
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx-host-networking-ports
      name: nginx-host-networking-ports-disallowed-2
    spec:
      ephemeralContainers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9001
          hostPort: 9001
      hostNetwork: true

    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
