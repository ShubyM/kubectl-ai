    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Requires resources to contain specified labels, with values matching provided regular expressions.

    ## Policy Message
    All namespaces must have an `owner` label that points to your company username

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    labels:
    - allowedRegex: ^[a-zA-Z]+.agilebank.demo$
      key: owner
    message: All namespaces must have an `owner` label that points to your company username
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Namespace

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: allowed-namespace
      labels:
        owner: user.agilebank.demo
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      name: disallowed-namespace
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    metadata:
      labels:
        owner: user
      name: disallowed-namespace-2

    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
