    You are reviewing Kubernetes resources for policy compliance.

    ## Policy Rule
    Sets a maximum ratio for container resource limits to requests.
    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/

    ## Policy Parameters
    ```yaml
    cpuRatio: "10"
    ratio: "1"
    ```

    ## Applicable Resource Types
    This policy applies to: Pod

    ## Resources to Review
    Below are the Kubernetes resource definitions to analyze:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: opa-allowed
      labels:
        owner: me.agilebank.demo
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: opa
          image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.9.2
          args:
            - "run"
            - "--server"
            - "--addr=localhost:8080"
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "4"
              memory: "2Gi"
            requests:
              cpu: "1"
              memory: "2Gi"
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Pod
    metadata:
      name: opa-disallowed
      labels:
        owner: me.agilebank.demo
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: opa
          image: openpolicyagent/opa:0.9.2
          args:
            - "run"
            - "--server"
            - "--addr=localhost:8080"
          resources:
            limits:
              cpu: "4"
              memory: "2Gi"
            requests:
              cpu: "100m"
              memory: "2Gi"
    ```

    ## Task
    Review the resources above and identify which ones violate the policy.

    List each violating resource in the format: `Kind/Name` with a brief explanation of why it violates the policy.
    If a resource is compliant, you do not need to list it.
